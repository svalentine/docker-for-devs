The mac version comes with docker-compose however I _think_ the linux version does not.

## Getting Started ##

Clone this repository to your system. check that docker and docker compose are installed and functional with

- `docker -v` - Should return something like `Docker version 18.09.0, build 4d60db4`
- `docker-compose -v` - should return something like `docker-compose version 1.23.2, build 1110ad01`

## Next steps ##

```bash
git checkout slide-1
```
